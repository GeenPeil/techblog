On this GeenPeil sub-site you'll find the latest information about the member consultation software and associated projects.

This blog is meant for everyone interested in the technical side of GeenPeil. Posts will contain information about a variety of subjects including:

- Security and Privacy
- Functional designs
- Project setup and code
- Continuous Integration and testing
- Infrastructure

Please bear in mind that we're on a tight schedule, and we might not be able to display as much as we would like. Probably we will have some catching up to do, after the General Elections. If you're interested in the code we're writing, do visit our [GitHub](https://github.com/GeenPeil).

ps. Yes. The title is indeed a reference to [Mr. Robot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eps1.0_hellofriend.mov).
